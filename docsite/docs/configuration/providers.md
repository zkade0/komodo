# Providers

Providers allow Komodo to authenticate against external git providers and docker registries on behalf of your resources. Once configured, provider accounts are available to attach to Builds, Repos, Stacks, and Resource Syncs.

### Usage

When configuring a Build, Repo, Stack, or Resource Sync that references a private repository, select the matching git provider and account in the resource's configuration. Komodo will use the token to authenticate the clone.

## Managing Providers in the UI

The easiest way to set up providers is through the Komodo UI. Navigate to **Settings > Providers** to manage your git and registry accounts. From this page you can:

- **Add** new git provider or docker registry accounts (domain, username, and access token).
- **View** accounts that were added via the UI as well as those loaded from config files.
- **Edit or delete** database-managed accounts.

## Configuring via Config Files

As an alternative to the UI, providers can be defined in config files:

- **Core config** (`core.config.toml`): Accounts are available globally to all resources. See [Advanced Configuration](../setup/advanced.mdx#mount-a-config-file).
- **Periphery config** (`periphery.config.toml`): Accounts are only available to resources running on that specific server. See [Connect Servers](../setup/connect-servers.mdx).

Accounts from config files also appear in the UI under **Settings > Providers**, but their tokens cannot be read back through the API or UI.

## Git Providers

Komodo supports cloning repos over HTTP/S from any provider that supports 

```shell
git clone https://<Username>:<Token>@<domain>/<Owner>/<Repo>
```

or 

```shell
git clone https://<Token>@<domain>/<Owner>/<Repo>
```

This includes GitHub, GitLab,
[Bitbucket](https://github.com/moghtech/komodo/issues/387#issuecomment-3240726344),
Forgejo, Gitea, and many other git providers.

### Cloning over SSH

Builds, Repos, Stacks, and Resource Syncs can instead clone over SSH by enabling
**`git_ssh`** on the resource (in the UI, click the `https://` button next to the
git provider until it reads `git@`). The remote becomes:

```shell
git clone git@<domain>:<Owner>/<Repo>
```

This is useful where a personal access token is undesirable - GitHub deploy keys, for
example, are scoped to a single repository and are not tied to a user account.

There are two ways to supply the key.

#### 1. The host's ssh config

Leave the account's `ssh_key` empty (or attach no account at all) and git uses the ssh
config of whichever host performs the clone - Core for Resource Syncs, the target
server's Periphery otherwise. Place the key at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` for the user
Periphery runs as, or add a `Host` entry to that user's `~/.ssh/config`, and make sure
the provider's host key is in `known_hosts`.

Best when you already manage host keys with configuration management.

#### 2. Komodo-managed key

Set `ssh_key` on the git provider account, either in **Settings > Providers** or in a
config file. Komodo then distributes the key to whichever server runs the clone, the
same way it distributes tokens today, so a new server needs no ssh setup of its own:

```toml
# in core.config.toml or periphery.config.toml

[[git_provider]]
domain = "github.com"
accounts = [
  { username = "my-user", ssh_key = """
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
""" },
]
```

The key is written to a temporary file with mode `0600` for the duration of each git
command and removed immediately afterwards. It is passed to git via `core.sshCommand`
with `IdentitiesOnly=yes` and `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`, so the provider's
host key is trusted on first use rather than needing to be seeded.

An `ssh_key` stored on an account is held in plain text, exactly like `token` - the
same caveats about database and host access apply. Prefer a read-only key.

### Fields

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `domain` | `github.com` | The hostname of the git provider. Do not include the protocol (`http://` or `https://`). |
| `https` | `true` | Whether to clone over HTTPS. Set to `false` for HTTP (e.g. local development). Ignored when the resource has `git_ssh` enabled. |
| `accounts` | `[]` | A list of `{ username, token }` pairs. Each account provides access to repos visible to that user. |

### Configuration

```toml
# in core.config.toml or periphery.config.toml

[[git_provider]]
domain = "github.com"
accounts = [
  { username = "my-user", token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx" },
]

[[git_provider]]
domain = "git.example.com" # self-hosted Gitea, GitLab, etc.
accounts = [
  { username = "my-user", token = "access_token" },
]

[[git_provider]]
domain = "localhost:3000"
https = false # clone over http://
accounts = [
  { username = "my-user", token = "access_token" },
]
```

## Docker Registries

Komodo supports pushing and pulling images from any Docker-compatible registry, including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), and self-hosted registries.

### Fields

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `domain` | `docker.io` | The hostname of the registry. Can include `http://` for insecure registries, but this requires [insecure registries](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/dockerd/#insecure-registries) enabled on your hosts. |
| `accounts` | `[]` | A list of `{ username, token }` pairs for registry authentication. |
| `organizations` | `[]` | Optional list of organization/namespace names. When attached to a Build, images are published under the organization's namespace instead of the account's. |

### Configuration

```toml
# in core.config.toml or periphery.config.toml

[[image_registry]]
domain = "docker.io"
accounts = [
  { username = "my-user", token = "dckr_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxx" },
]
organizations = ["MyOrg"]

[[image_registry]]
domain = "ghcr.io"
accounts = [
  { username = "my-user", token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx" },
]

[[image_registry]]
domain = "registry.example.com" # self-hosted registry
accounts = [
  { username = "my-user", token = "access_token" },
]
organizations = ["MyTeam"]
```

:::note
Your GitHub access token must have the `write:packages` permission in order to push images.
For example, see the [GitHub docs on access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic).

### Usage

When configuring a Build, select the registry domain and account to push images to. If organizations are defined, you can choose to publish under an organization namespace.

When a Build is connected to a Deployment, the Deployment inherits the registry configuration by default. If that account is not available to the Deployment's server, you can choose a different account in the Deployment config.
